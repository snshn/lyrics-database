For all these years I’ve been rushing and running away
I’ve seen the cities, the bars and beaches
A fool to keep away from you

I know I’ll meet you a day for a lifetime, I’m scared
One thousand years I can live on your smile
No escape, I’ll run away forever

Call it love, just call it love

For all that time I’ve been crazy, there is no escape
I’m back in the city, I’m back in my hometown and wait
I see your eyes forever

I know I’ll meet you a day for a lifetime, I’m scared
One thousand years I can live on your smile
No escape, I’ll run away forever
