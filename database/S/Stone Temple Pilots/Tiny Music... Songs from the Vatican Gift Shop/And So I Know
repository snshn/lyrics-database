And so I know
It’s begun again
Never be the same
And with that I said, "never, ever be this way again"

Hold on ’til the end (campfire girls make me feel alright)
Like it’s the last hello
Whirlwinds and rollercoasters (campfire girls make)
Long grass making shapes "hello"

Disappearing, disappearing floating graves

Never, ever-ever-ever be this way
And never ever be this way again

Never, ever-ever-ever be this way
And never, ever be this way again

And so I know (campfire girls make me)
It’s begun again (feel alright)
Never be the same (campfire girls make me)
And with that I said (feel alright)

(Campfire girls make me feel alright)
(Campfire girls make me feel alright)

Campfire girls
