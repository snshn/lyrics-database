Driving down the open road, ye
Follow ...
Well, you look so fine
And I wanna make you mine
Well, I ain’t got a dime but I better have could
You can move your soul to my rock’n’roll

Shake!
Shake!

Clock on the wall says I'm leaving soon, ye
The jukebox playin’ your favorite tune
Well, you look so good
Knock on the wood
Well, I ain’t got a dime but I better have could
You can move your soul to my rock’n’roll

Shake!
Shake!

Come on babe
Shake it for me
Yea…

Shake!

Shake!

Shake!
