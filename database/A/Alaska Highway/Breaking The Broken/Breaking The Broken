How could I have been so foolish?
How could I have been so blind?
What will it take for me to find
The place where you are inside of my mind?
Within and safe, protected by tears.
Hiding, a coward behind all of your fears.

I may be seen as perfect
But I still feel pain.
And all of your passions have been nothing
But a mind-distracting game.

Just tell me what it is that I have done
To be a victim of hope and hated by the sun.
I find in all of this a great misery,
And nothing seems to make any sense to me.

Could it be a memory, could I have ever existed?
The words you spoke, could I have resisted?
Keep all of your heart and then depart
Before the wings of an angel had been torn apart.

I may be seen as perfect
But I still feel pain.
And all of your passions have been nothing
But a mind-distracting game.

Just tell me what it is that I have done
To be a victim of hope and hated by the sun.
I find in all of this a great misery,
And nothing seems to make any sense to me.

I am more than what I have become,
But am a fool to have believed that you were the one
To save me from my desperate state.
How my love has turned so deeply into hate?

I may be seen as perfect
But I still feel pain.
And all of your passions have been nothing
But a mind-distracting game.

Just tell me what it is that I have done
To be a victim of hope and hated by the sun.
I find in all of this great misery,
Does any of this make sense to me?
