Are you breathing what I’m breathing?
Are your wishes the same as mine?
Are you needing what I’m needing?
I’m waiting for a sign

My hands tremble
My heart aches
Is it you calling?
Is it you calling?

If I’m alone in this
I don’t think I can face
The consequences of falling (the consequences of falling)
The consequences of falling (the consequences of falling)

Are you thinking what I’m thinking?
Does your pulse quicken like mine?
Are you dreaming what I’m dreaming?
I can’t read your mind

One step towards you
Two steps back
Feels like I’m crawling
Feels like I’m crawling

If I’m alone in this
I don’t think I can face
The consequences of falling (the consequences of falling)
The consequences of falling (the consequences of falling)

My hands tremble
My heart aches
Is it you calling?
Is it you calling?

If I’m alone in this
I don’t think I can face
The consequences of falling (the consequences of falling)
The consequences of falling (the consequences of falling)
The consequences of falling (the consequences of falling)
The consequences of falling (the consequences of falling)
The consequences of falling (the consequences of falling)
The consequences of falling (the consequences of falling)

(The consequences of falling)
(The consequences of falling)
(The consequences of falling)
(The consequences of falling)
