Your mind and your experience
Call to me
You have lived, and your intelligence
Is sexy

I wanna know what you’ve got to say
I wanna know what you’ve got to say
I wanna know what you’ve got to say
I can tell you taste like the sky ’cause you look like rain

You look like rain, you look like rain
You look like rain, you look like rain
You look like rain, you look like rain
You look like rain, you look like rain

You think like a whip
On a horse’s back
Stretched out to the limit you make it crack
Send that horse ’round and ’round the track

I wanna know what you’ve got to say
I wanna know what you’ve got to say
I wanna know what you’ve got to say
I can tell you taste like the sky ’cause you look like rain

You look like rain, you look like rain
You look like rain, you look like rain
You look like rain, you look like rain
You look like rain, you look like rain

You look like rain, you look like rain
You look like rain, you look like rain
You look like rain, you look like rain
You look like rain, you look like rain

Yea, you look like rain

You look like rain…
